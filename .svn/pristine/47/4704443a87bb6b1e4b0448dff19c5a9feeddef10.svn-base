  <shortdesc>QHEFermionsCoulomb evalutes spectrum for N fermions on Haldane sphere with 2S quantum flux and with laplacian delta interaction.</shortdesc>
  <longdesc>QHEFermionsCoulomb evalutes spectrum for N fermions on Haldane sphere with 2S quantum flux and with laplacian delta interaction. It produces a file \filename{fermions\_laplaciandelta\_n\_xx\_2s\_yy\_lz.dat} where xx is the number of fermions and yy the number of quantum fluxes. It contains the lowest eigenvalues in each sector of given projection of the total momentum $L_z$. The first number of each line is $L_z$ and the second one is the state energy.

The results use the following convention. Only the interaction term has been taken into account. The pseudo-potential has only one non-zero term $V_1$ with\\
\begin{eqnarray}
V_1=\frac{(2S+1)^2}{S(4S-1)}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}

Typical usage of this program is as follow:\\
\commandarray{QHEFermionsCoulomb -p 8 -l 21 -n 30}
This command get at least 30 eigenvalues in each $L_z$ sector for 8 particles with 21 quantum fluxes. The minimum number of eigenvalues is fixed by the \option{n} option. QHEFermionsCoulomb uses full diagonalization algorithm for small Hilbert space dimension and L\'anczos algorithm for larger space. The limit dimension between small and large space can be changed using the \longoption{full-diag} option. 
Calculation can be done on a subset of possible $L_z$ value using the \longoption{initial-lz}, \longoption{nbr-lz} and \longoption{ground} options.

You can also smoothly turn from the laplacian delta to the Coulomb interaction using the \longoption{add-coulomb} option. In that case, the pseudopotentials are such that $V_1$ is the one of the laplacian delta in every case and the other pseudopotentials are those of the Coulomb interaction times a scaling factor
\begin{eqnarray}
\alpha V_{1\; coulomb} /  V_{1\; laplacian}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha$ is the number used with the \longoption{add-coulomb} option.\\

To improve calcution speed, you can tune different parameters. Optimization for multiprocessors computer with shared memory architecture can be turned on using the \longoption{SMP} option. The number of processors to use is defined through the \longoption{processors} option. QHEFermionsCoulomb tries to precalculate matrix element as most as it can. You can use the \longoption{memory} to allow the program to use more memory for this task (tests have been done up to 32GBytes). If you need more than the ground state energy, the program uses reothorgonalized version of the L\'anczos algorithm. In that case, all vectors produced by the algorithm are stored in memory and this later can be quickly full and prevent from using too large precalculation datas. To allow larger precalculation datas, you can limit the number of L\'anczos vectors stored in memory. For example\\
\commandarray{QHEFermionsCoulomb -p 11 -l 30 -n 2 --initial-lz 0 --nbr-lz 1 --disk --nbr-iter 20 nbr-vector 6 --memory 1000}
will perform the 20 first L\'anczos iterations needed for the calculation of the ground state and first excited state energies only for $L_z=0$. 1 GBytes of memory will be used for precalculations and only 6 L\'anczos vectors will be stored in RAM. Notice that the other L\'anczos vectors are stored on disk in files \filename{vector.xxx} and a gobal file \filename{lanczos.dat}. Using this technique, you can resume a calculation by adding the \longoption{resume} option (in that case, program must be start in the directory where the \filename{vector.xxx} and \filename{lanczos.dat} are stored). Moreover, this feature is usefull if you have time restriction for your running job.

If you use the resume feature, it can be smart not to do the precalculations serveral times. During the first run, use \command{--save-precalculation my\_precalculations}, where \filename{my\_precalculations} is the file where precalculations will be stored. For the other runs, just use \command{--load-precalculation my\_precalculations}. These precalculations  are only valid for a given number of particles, quantum fluxes AND $L_z$ value.

Finally, you can tune the \longoption{fast-search} parameter which is used to speed up quantum state search sequence during calculations. Beware that performance can worst if a too large value is used (this problem is linked to the CPU cache size).

  <accuracy>QHEFermionsCoulomb uses the most of the components of \programwithlink{QHE}{QHEFermionsCoulomb}. Due to the shift used during L\'anczos calculations, the actual eigenvalue precision is $10^{-13}$ even if the L\'anczos convergence has been fixed to $10^{-14}$. The L\'anczos algorithm used here can be subject to spurious degeneracy (so you can not be sure of eigenvalue degeneracy). This program has been used in \paperwithlink{cond-mat/0404093}{cond-mat/0404093}.  </accuracy>

    <description>This script allow to parse spectrums to find the neutral gap including finite size scaling. StartN and StartS arguments are the number of particle and the number of quantum fluxes of the first spectrum to study, NInc and SInc are the increments to the next spectrum (so that NInc/SInc is the filling factor). Gnuplot is needed in order to this script to work. This script assumes that Lz-sorted spectrums are sorted in directories n\_xx where xx is the number of particles. A data file containing is created using a two column ascii style where first column is 1/N and the second one the corresponding neutral gap. The name of this file is \filename{fermions\_laplaciandelta\_gap\_Caption.dat} where Caption is the fifth argument passed to the script. A postscript file  \filename{fermions\_laplaciandelta\_gap\_Caption.ps} is also created containin the graph 1/N vs neutral gap.</description>

    <description>This script allow to parse spectrums to find the ground state energy per particles for a given linear relation between N and 2S and compare it to the equivalent energy for a model of free composite fermions on sphere. StartN and StartS arguments are the number of particle and the number of quantum fluxes of the first spectrum to study, NInc and SInc are the increments to the next spectrum (so that NInc/SInc is the filling factor). Optional argument 1\_N\_Factor and Shift can be used to substract the value
\begin{eqnarray}
V_1=\frac{1}{N_{{\rm Factor}}}\frac{1}{N} + {\rm Shift}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
to the ground state energy. The script automatically substracts the ground state of the closest filled shell system (with a smaller of equal N value.) to the current value.
Gnuplot is needed in order to this script to work. This script assumes that Lz-sorted spectrums are sorted in directories \directoryname{n\_xx} where xx is the number of particles.

A postscript file  \filename{fermions\_laplaciandelta\_ground\_Caption.ps} is also created containing the graph 1/N vs ground state energy per particle.
