    <h1>Aix installation</h1>


    Due to some problems with xlC and autoconf/automake, the installation procedure is a bit different.<br> 
First you have to be sure that the global variable <b>$CXX</b> is set to <b>xlC</b> (if not use <b>export CXX=xlC</b>). In order to create correct Makefiles, the <i>configure</i> and <i>Makefile.in</i> files have to be patched. You can find in the <i>scripts</i> directory a perl script called <i>AIXPatch.pl</i>. Run it from the top directory (aka <i>DiagHam</i>). Now you can continue to the <a href="index.html">standard installation procedure</a>. Beware to use <b>gmake</b> (GNU make) instead of <b>make</b>.<br>
<p>
    DiagHam has been tested on AIX v5 with xlC v6. The test machine was an IBM power4 with 32 processors and 256Gb.<br>
